//***FILE 542 is from Alastair Gray and contains some handy tools   *   FILE 542
//*           (so far), which are described below.  One is a REXX   *   FILE 542
//*           which is an MCNVTCAT replacement, and the other is    *   FILE 542
//*           a tool to find all the catalog alias names in the     *   FILE 542

//*      Here are a number of bits of handy REXX code, the list     *   FILE 542

//*      There are some of samples of using the DFSMS/MVS           *   FILE 542
