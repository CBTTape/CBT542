Hello Sam,

it is a long time ago, that you heard from me.

Two Years ago I retired, but from time to time I am asked by good friends for
some support.

I recommended using the SPACENEW to one of them.

We recognized, that with z/OS v2r3 and still in v2r5 the
IDCAMS DCOLLECT records for ACTIVE DATA SET INFORMATION (RECORD
TYPE "D") were enlarged.

So for this the LRECL for OUTDS in Subroutine DISP_VOLUME must be adjusted.
This has been done in member SPACEZ23.
You find a new member in the attached file. Please add this to CBT file 542.

Many Greetings

Andreas
