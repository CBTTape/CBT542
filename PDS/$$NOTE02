Hi Sam,

As per our phone conversation, I'm now been 'off' the mainframe
for a few years, having moved into the SAN and storage area.

However I'm still available to try and help with any queries that
may be raised against my code.

My updated contact details for the CBT are :

alastair.gray@pmi.com
+41 58 242 7690

Nice to speak to you and keep up the good work.

Regards,
Alastair
