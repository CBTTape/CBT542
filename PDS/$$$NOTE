Hi Sam,

After the exchange on IBM-MAIN earlier in the week, I thought I'd
polish these bits of code up and submit them to the CBT. I hope
they may be of use.

The xmitted file contains :

ALICOUNT - A REXX alias counter for finding our how many datasets
are using each alias.

RCNVTCAT - A REXX MCNVTCAT replacement which 'should' produce
identical output (more or less).

MAKEINDX - A REXX to generate an index for code libraries from
standard comments (added because I used it on the library I've
sent).

Supporting JCL for the two CSI functions is also included.

I have a significant amount of 'handy' REXX code (for sysprogs
and others) that I hope to tidy a little bit more over the coming
months this submission may then increase in size if it seems of
use.  (I do have a number of other MCAT related functions,
currently they are rather site specific but 'may' get picked up
as a part of my general tidy).

Regards,
