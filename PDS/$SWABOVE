                  RCNVTCAT WITH SWA ABOVE THE LINE
                  -------- ---- --- ----- --- ----


RCNVTCAT is a REXX exec which works under TSO.  It is also supposed to
   work under OMVS (UNIX in z/OS) but has been in process of being
   fixed for OMVS.  It works under TSO, which should be sufficient for
   most people's purposes.

   The old version of RCNVTCAT was supposed to work under both TSO and
   OVMS, but it doesn't work when SWA (JES2 Scheduler Work Area) is
   set (in JES2 parms for JOBCLASS(TSU) or TSUCLASS) as SWA=ABOVE (SWA
   above the 16 meg line.)

   RCNVTCAT was written by Alastair Gray.

   RCNVTCAT was fixed further by John McKown to run under UNIX (OMVS).
            See member $$NOTE03 in this pds for details about his part
            of the project.  RCNVTCAT (for TSO) was originally fixed
            for SWA above the line, by Lionel Dyck, so it now should
            work for all cases, under TSO.


SYNTAX :   RCNVTCAT 'catalog.name' Ý'second.cat.name'¨ (second name
                                                        is optional
                                                        and is used
                                                        to compare 2
                                                        catalogs)


PURPOSE:   RCNVTCAT runs against a VSAM (or ICF) catalog, and produces
           a PDS which contains DEFINE statements to recatalog most of
           the original catalog's entries.  This is very useful, for
           example, when you are making a new system, and you want to
           recatalog the entries from the old master catalog into a
           brand new master catalog that you are making.  RCNVTCAT
           will produce most of the DEFINE statements which (when
           edited) will enable you to do that, and populate the new
           master catalog with the proper dataset entries that you
           need there.

           RCNVTCAT is a "replacement" (not from IBM) to an unofficial
           IBM program called MCNVTCAT, which was distributed with CBIPO
           and CBPDO IBM software distributions.  The IBM "system
           packaging" people developed MCNVTCAT (NOT the IBM development
           programmers) and so, MCNVTCAT was an unsupported program that
           IBM dropped support for.  All of us "old systems programmers"
           tried to save copies of MCNVTCAT, which still works, but you
           can't get new copies of it from IBM.

           Alastair Gray wrote RCNVTCAT to completely replace MCNVTCAT.

           RCNVTCAT is much easier to use than MCNVTCAT.  RCNVTCAT runs
           under TSO.  MCNVTCAT ran in batch, with complicated JCL that
           you have to set up.  (Once set up, it was easy to run.)
           As you see above, RCNVTCAT is very easy to use.  Point it to
           one catalog name, and it will produce DEFINE statements for
           its entries.  Give it TWO catalog names, and it will compare
           the two catalogs' entries to each other.


PROBLEM:   Under TSO, RCNVTCAT stopped working when SWA=ABOVE was set
           in the JES2 parms.  The REXX will not allocate a temporary
           dataset to put its output in, when SWA=ABOVE is coded for
           the TSU jobclass.

SOLUTION (partial):
           Lionel Dyck fixed RCNVTCAT to work under TSO for SWA=ABOVE,
           but his fix works only for TSO operation (which most people
           use) and not for OMVS operation (I don't know why Alastair
           wrote that).

           For people who run RCNVTCAT under TSO (almost everyone), and
           if SWA=ABOVE is set for TSU in the JES2 parms (which happens
           a lot), then those people who need to use RCNVTCAT now have a
           solution.

           Lionel's fixed RCNVTCAT is presented here as member RCNVTCAT.

           Alastair Gray's original exec, is presented here as member
           RCNVTCAO.

           John McKown is currently working on enhancing RCNVTCAT to
           work under OMVS.
